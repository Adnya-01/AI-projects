# Project Summary
This project demonstrates how to build a semantic search system using Pinecone and vector embeddings on a multilingual translation dataset. English sentences from the Tatoeba English–Spanish corpus are automatically embedded using Pinecone’s llama-text-embed-v2 model and stored in a vector index.

Users can submit natural-language queries (for example, different meanings of the word “fan”), and Pinecone retrieves the most semantically similar sentences, even when the wording is different. This shows how vector search goes beyond keyword matching by understanding the meaning and context of text.

The project highlights how modern embedding-based search can be used for tasks like semantic retrieval, multilingual search, and intelligent text matching.
